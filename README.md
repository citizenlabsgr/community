# Community
We will use this space to share information and provide resources for members of Citizen Labs.

# How To Participate
We welcome the participation of everyone in contributing to improving Citizen Labs and our community. To maintain our positive community we require all participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/community/blob/master/coc.md). Please make sure you read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/community/blob/master/coc.md) before participating.

If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.
