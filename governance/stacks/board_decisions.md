# Board Decisions

These are designed to provide cursory guidelines for when board votes are required to address organizational concerns.

The board should be consulted:
* as dictated in the bylaws (e.g. new board members, amendments, election of officers);
* establishing a budget;
* reviewing and approving financial reports;  
* all expenditures above $100;
* resolving inter-member disputes;
* contractually binding the organization to any person or party; and
* adopting or adjusting policies and procedures.

The chairman and/or executive team may take action without a board vote in cases including, but not limited to:
* conversing with potential partners, interested parties, or exploring future opportunities provided the organization is not contractually bound;
* expenses or reimbursements within budget and below $100; and
* standard day-to-day business (e.g. scheduling meetings, hosting hack nights).

If there is doubt in the appropriateness of taking action without a board vote, please bring it to the board's attention.
