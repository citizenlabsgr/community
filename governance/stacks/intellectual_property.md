# DRAFT: Intellectual Property Rights

## Our Inspiration
Transparency and the application of open source technologies are core principals to Citizen Labs. Another core principal is the power of open source technology when applied to civic projects. Often times Citizen Labs will apply open source technologies developed elsewhere to improve our community, in a pay-it-forward fashion, likewise Citizen Labs provides our work product as open source so that others may benefit.

It is important that contributing individuals of Citizen Labs understand when how the open sourced projects impact the Intellectual Property Rights of Citizen Labs and the individual contributor.
