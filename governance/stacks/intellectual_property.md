# DRAFT: Intellectual Property Rights

## Our Inspiration
Transparency and the application of open source technologies are core principals to Citizen Labs. Another core principal is the power of open source technology when applied to civic projects. Often times Citizen Labs will apply open source technologies developed elsewhere to improve our community, in a pay-it-forward fashion, likewise Citizen Labs provides our work product as open source so that others may benefit.

It is important that contributing individuals of Citizen Labs understand when how the open sourced projects impact the Intellectual Property Rights of Citizen Labs and the individual contributor.

### Goals

- Protect the Intellectual Property Rights of participants for their contributions.
- Permit Citizen Labs to offer any Work as Open Sourced software

### Realize
- Projects will consist of varying degrees of individual contributions
- Citizen Labs does not have the capacity to ensure the originality of individual contributions. This responsibility rests with the participant.


## Method: Intellectual Property Rights

Every Citizen Labs project repository should include a license that clearly states the overall licensing rules of the project and final product.
