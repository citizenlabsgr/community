### OPEN THOUGHTS

Congrats to us! We have come very far in just under a year. The big news of course is that this week we were designated by the IRS as a 501c3 nonprofit. The designation also kicked off a flurry of new work as we were able to use our new 501c3 for many discounted/free services and fundraising.

Here are some of the highlights:
- Gsuite: We now have a nonprofit organizational account with Google for GSuite. We now can easily offer and manage yourname@citizenlabs.org email addresses, shared documents and schedules among us.
 - email invites went out to all Board members.
- Benevity: We are currently setting up our profile in Benevity which is a service that supports corporate employee giving and volunteering with approved nonprofits. We have been approved for inclusion!
- Meetup: [We are back on Meetup.](https://www.meetup.com/Citizen-Labs/)
- Slack: Now we have nonprofit status.
- Bank account: A bank account is now very important. We will need to connect it to the various donation sources (Benevity & Facebook currently) and also for approved payments.
- Other free and discounts products and services offered through [Techsoup](http://www.techsoup.org)

There have also been some updates to the online public face of Citizen Labs. Our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/citizenlabs) is currently celebrating our 501c3 designation. For the past several months we have been testing [Brigadehub for dynamic information about Citizen Labs](https://hub.citizenlabs.org/), which is being developed by the San Francisco brigade of Code for America. The current plan is to integrate it with the our [Github posted website](https://citizenlabs.org).

As you know our projects are a mix of collaboration with local government/organization and organic ones people bring into Hack Nights. We have new projects from both sources.

Hack Night Projects:
- Tree canopy census/analysis: Project Guide, Lee
- Housing (rental property analysis & visualization): Project Guide, Kolt
- Chatbot for answering city service questions: Project Guide, Brandon

City of GR, Planning Department: Citizen Labs met this past month with city planning department staff. We discussed broadly social equity aspects of development projects. We also discussed potential opportunities with the development River Edge Guidelines as part of the overall Grand River Restoration effort. There was a lot of energy and good ideas shared for the River Edge Guidelines, work on this will likely begin in June/July.

My priorities for the next month will be bringing Benevity online with Citizen Labs. We have done a lot of work for onboarding, but I think there are still more opportunities.


### NEXT MEETING

June 13: Meeting will be held via Slack @ #board-meetings.
