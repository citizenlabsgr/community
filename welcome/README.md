# How To Participate

Please make sure you read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/community/blob/main/coc.md) before participating. Following our Code of Conduct is a requirement for participation. Beyond the Code of Conduct we welcome the participation of everyone in contributing to improving our brigade and our community. If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.
